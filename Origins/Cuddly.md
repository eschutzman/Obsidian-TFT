(1) At the start of combat, Yuumi attaches herself to the nearest ally, or to the lowest Health ally after being unattached for 2 seconds. Attaching to an ally grants them a shield equal to 60% of Yuumi's maximum Health. Yuumi detaches if the shield breaks.  
  
While attached, Yuumi is untargetable and cannot attack, but gains 5 Mana per second, and 10 Mana whenever the ally attacks.
