# Leveling Timeline
## 	Level 8 on 4-2
* Common Opening
    * [[Yordle]] with early loss streak → 8 on 4-2 with 30 gold
    * Roll until stable
    * If this is done correctly you shouldn’t have to replace all units, just rolling for upgrades
* Common boards
    * AD  = [[Yordle]], [[Bodyguard]], [[Tristana]]
    * AP = [[Yordle]] [[Bodyguard]] [[Malzahar]]
* NOTE:
    * Sub gold @ 3-2 is okay
    * **40 gold with yordle in @ 3-2 level 6**



## Level 8 on 4-5
* Dropped [[Yordle|Yordles]] or didn’t play
* Streaked Early 
* Don’t be scared to roll slightly on 7
* If not on pace for 4-2, roll to 10/20 gold if it makes sense



## Level 8 on 5-1
* Don’t be here
* You are wrong, do better


# Synergies

## [[Mutant]]
* Play if Mutant buff is really good for [[Kaisa]]
* Bioleeching is really good
* Voracious Appetite is good w/ phony frontline augment/ lots of units



## Stand United Augment
* Run board around 
    * [[Yummi]]
    * [[Leona]]
    * [[Braum]]
    * [[Jayce]]
    * [[Fiora]]
    * [[Kaisa]]
        * Play there slowly but it should be easy just play synergies

## General Notes

* Don’t bother making [[Infinity Edge|IE]] unless you have Last Whisper or Jeweled Gauntles/IE Fiora
* [[Hand Of Justice|HOJ]] is meh item but slam it on [[Ezreal]] 2 if streaking → 4-5 w/60 HP, this is to secure top 4
* Slamming Items → Streak stage 2 → Lose a few rounds but not 10-0’d stage 3 → 4-5 w/60 HP → Roll until stable, hold transitions
* Slamming Items → streak stage 3 → highroll augments – fast 9 → first place dub
* Don’t Slam Items → 4-2 properly don’t just spam refresh without buying
* Don’t be scared to take top 5 and move on
* Over 100 games if you are in top 5 → infinite LP gains
