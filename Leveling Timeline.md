# Level 8 on 4-2
###  Common Opening
	- Yordle with early loss streak → 8 on 4-2 with 30 gold
	- Roll until stable
	- If this is done correctly you shouldn’t have to replace all units, just rolling for upgrades
### Common boards
	- AD  = Yordle, Bodyguard, Tristana
	- AP = Yordle Bodyguard Malzahar
	
	NOTE:
		Sub gold @ 3-2 is okay
		40 gold with yordle in @ 3-2 level 6

# Level 8 on 4-5
+ Dropped Yordles or didn’t play
- Streaked Early 
+ Don’t be scared to roll slightly on 7
+ If not on pace for 4-2, roll to 10/20 gold if it makes sense
