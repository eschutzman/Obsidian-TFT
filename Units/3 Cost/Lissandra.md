Lissandra encases her target in an iron maiden, stunning them for 1.5 seconds and dealing magic damage to enemies within a large area. Damage from the iron maiden reduces enemies' Attack Damage by 30% for 4 seconds.  
  
If Lissandra is below 50% Health, she encases herself instead, dealing damage to surrounding enemies and becoming untargetable and invulnerable for 2 seconds.

Damage : 225 / 300 / 500
